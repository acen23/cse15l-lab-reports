# Lab Report 3: Streamlining ssh Configuration
by Andrew Cen

- First, I created the file ~/.ssh/config and filled in the contents using my Macbook's default text editor, TextEdit: ![config-contents](https://acen23.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/Lab6Screenshot1.png)
- Once this was set up, I was able to log in quickly to the ieng6 server using my custom username "acen": ![new-login](https://acen23.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/Lab6Screenshot2.png)
- To test this with scp, I created a file called copy-file.md before sending it over to the server with my new username: ![new-scp](https://acen23.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/Lab6Screenshot3.png)
